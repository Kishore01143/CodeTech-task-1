### Objective 
Blinking an LED is an introductory Arduino project in which we control an LED using Arduino. LED blinking refers to the process of continuously turning an LED (Light Emitting Diode) and off in a repetitive pattern. It is a simple and common demonstration in electronics and microcontroller-based projects.
